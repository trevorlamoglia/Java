# Overview

Java gives me a competitive advantage. As an aspiring software engineer, I would want to stand out from the rest, learning a server-side programming language like Java will help you stand out, and make you eligible for tens of thousands of server-side programming jobs.

This software has items that are put in the program just like a shoping cart. It also takes in the unit price and quantity of the items that were put in and just like a normal shopping, after you're done, it gives you a receipt that shows the total amount (price)

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- Java

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based and object-oriented. The programming language is structured in such a way that developers can write code anywhere and run it anywhere without worrying about the underlying computer architecture.
